# Note on fonts and copyright

Fonts, including chess diagram fonts, can not be copyrighted in the
United States.  These fonts have been developed in the United
States.

Note that some glphs are *not* public domain in jurisdictions which
allow fonts to be copyrighted, but is still available under an
[open source license](https://github.com/lehoff/skak/blob/master/LICENSE).
Since some jurisdictions which protect fonts only protect them for
shorter terms, it appears that the Shak font was first published in
2002, so copyright expired before 2013 in Germany (10 years protection
without registration), and expired before 2018 in Ireland (15 years
protection).

Since the glyphs are derived from raster PNG images,
*Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.* does not apply.
