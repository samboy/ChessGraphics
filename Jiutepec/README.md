Chess Jiutepec is a conversion of some of the Chess icons in the public 
domain font Quivira in to images for a diagram Chess font.  Since the 
original icons are public domain, I am making this font public domain too.

Note that, while Quivira supports an incredible number of Chess variant
pieces, we only have support for the usual upside down bishop, upside
down knight, and a rook + knight pieces since Quivira has one.

The reason for the name Jiutepec is that I am continuing the tradition,
started with Chess Merida, of naming Chess fonts after beautiful places
in Mexico that I have been to.
