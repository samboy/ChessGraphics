# About this project

This is a project to make public domain graphics for Chess games.  While
a number of Chess piece graphics are available, none of them, to the
extent of my knowledge, are public domain.

# The .png files

The .png files come from my first-2000s-decade attempt to make public
domain graphics for the Chess Variant playing engine Zillions of Games.
Since this engine only supported low-resolution bitmap graphics, the
images here are low resolution png files.

The images are based on 19^th century Chess images, which, due to their
age, are public domain.
