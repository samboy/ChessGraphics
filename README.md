# About this project

This is a project to make public domain graphics for Chess games.  While
a number of Chess piece graphics are available, none of them, to the
extent of my knowledge, are public domain.

# The .png files

The .png files mainly come from my first-2000s-decade attempt to make
public domain graphics for the Chess Variant playing engine Zillions of
Games.  Since this engine only supported low-resolution bitmap graphics,
the images here are low resolution png files.

The images are based on 19th century Chess images, which, due to their
age, are public domain.

Since I was unable to find a suitable public domain Knight image back
then, I recently took an image of a Knight from Theophilus Thompson’s
1873 classic *Chess Problems: Either to Play and Mate*.  The other
images are very loosely based on images on the front cover of
Benjamin R. Foster’s 1887 book *Chancellor Chess*.

In both cases, the images are Public Domain: They were published before
1922 (yes, here in 2022, the cut off is before 1927, but it was 1922 when 
I made most of these images).
